# Spotify Search App

### Purpose
The purpose of this app is 2 fold. The main purpose is to eliminate the recommended new releases feature that spotify provides and  offer a unfiltered list of new releases. The second function of the app is to help find more sub genres and older albums to better understand your own music taste.

### Simple Walk Through

#### Pre-Requisite to use
Using this app requires a valid spotify premium account. Please provide the assocated email address to me and I will add you as an authorized user or see below on how the app functions.

#### Step One - Log In

#### Step Three - Search by genre
Feel free to search by favorite genres (The genres are preselected by me to suit my listening style). The layout will feel similar but the difference will be that all old and new albums will be loaded.

### Final Takeaway
This app helps me understand the sub genres I like so I can best select newly released albums. My overall fear of missing that one song or album that I will listen to on repeat months on end has been drastically been reduced thanks to this.
